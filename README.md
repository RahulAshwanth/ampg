# AMPG Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates and analyzes the Automatic MPG (Miles Per Gallon) estimation using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Overview 
This project aims to predict the fuel efficiency of automobiles based on their characteristics. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Evaluation and visualization of model results
## Project Structure
- AMPG.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
